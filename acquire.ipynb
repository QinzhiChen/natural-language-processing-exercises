However, many of our applicants actually learn in the application process – you don’t need to be an expert before applying! Data science is a very accessible field to anyone dedicated to learning new skills, and we can work with any applicant to help them learn what they need to know. But what “skills” do we mean, exactly? Just what exactly are the data science math and stats principles you need to know?\\nWhat are the main math principles you need to know to get into Codeup’s Data Science program?\\n\\n\\nAlgebra\\nDo you know PEMDAS and can you solve for x? You will need to be or become comfortable with the following:\\xa0\\n\\nVariables (x, y, n, etc.)\\nFormulas, functions, and variable manipulations (e.g. x^2 = x + 6, solve for x).\\nOrder of evaluation: PEMDAS: parentheses, exponents, then multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction\\nCommutativity where a + b = b + a\\nAssociativity where a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c\\nAdding and subtracting matrices\\nA conceptual understanding of exponential growth/decay- things can increase at an increasing rate\\n\\nDescriptive Statistics\\nKnow what a min, max, mode, median, and average are. Have a conceptual understanding that stats/probability is about trying to quantify uncertainty.\\nData Visualization\\nKnow what a scatterplot is and how to read a barplot.\\nHow to Learn and Expand on These Concepts\\nThere are a number of great resources out there to teach you these and similar concepts. Khan Academy is a great starting place for data science math! If you want to know what exactly we assign our applicants, you’ll just have to apply!\\n\\xa0\\nWhat about once you’re in Codeup?\\n\\n\\nWhat You Won’t Do\\nDo we do any mathematical proofs for concepts or perform derivations? No.\\xa0\\nDo we do any calculus and probability calculating by hand? No.\\nAre we transforming equations, where we cancel out units or terms and do lots of algebraic gymnastics? No\\nWhat You Will Do\\nWill we have Python solve our linear algebra problems for us? Yes\\nWill we have Python calculate probabilities, the area under a curve, and the slope of a line for us? Yes\\nWill we have Python do all of the calculus for us? Yes\\n\\xa0\\nSee, the data science math and stats slice of the pie is certainly doable. If you like problem-solving and are ready to challenge yourself, you’ll love data science! If you are interested in learning about data science, just apply! Our Admissions Manager can work with you to get you where you need to be starting from where you are now. Let us help you get there so you can launch a great new career.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur ProgramsCloud Administration\\nFull Stack Web Development\\nData Science\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Blog Articles\\nWhy Should You Learn to Code?\\nCoding Bootcamp or Computer Science Degree?\\nDiversity Equity and Inclusion Report\\nCodeup Honored as SABJ Diversity and Inclusion Award Winner\\nHow Can I Finance My Career Transition?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n'"
